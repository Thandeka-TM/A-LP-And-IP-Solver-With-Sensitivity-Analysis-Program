# A LP & IP Solver with Sensitivity Analysis Program

This is a Visual Studio project that uses a .NET language. The program includes a menu-driven interface that can read an input text file containing the mathematical model and export the results to an output text file.

Disclaimer: This Linear and Integer Programming project was not only developed by myself, my team members and I equally contributed to the project's development.
